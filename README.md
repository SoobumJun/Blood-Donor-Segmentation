# Blood-Donor-Segmentation
Blood donor clustering 


This project examines the validity of behavioral-based feature sets in segmenting donors and identifying active and inactive donor characteristics within CSL Behring's plasma donation operations. To complete this objective, the analysis implements a two-part methodology including both a clustering task using K-Modes as well as a predictive task using supervised learning methods to test performance of feature sets in identifying active donors. The analysis generated a set of novel behavioral features pertaining to frequency, duration, consistency and seasonality characteristics of donor behavior. The performance of this test feature set was compared against conventional behavior-based feature sets such as the Recency, Frequency, Monetary (RFM) Model. 

Used tools : Pyspark, Pandas, Numpy, Kmode(MIT generated package)
